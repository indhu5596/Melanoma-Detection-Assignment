## General Information
-Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- The developed CNN model shows promising results in accurately detecting different types of skin cancer. By leveraging deep learning techniques and data augmentation, the model can assist dermatologists in diagnosing melanoma and other skin cancer types. Further improvements can be made by collecting more diverse and balanced datasets and fine-tuning the model architecture.
